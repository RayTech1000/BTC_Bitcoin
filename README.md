Using the API from Yahoo finance to pipeline BTC Bitcoin data using Python. The data is then used to visualize the trends, highs, lows, opening, closing prices of Bitcoin. Can be used for any various stocks on Yahoo Finance as well. The main visual is for the 'Candlestick' graph that is commonly used for stocks and investments.

Github does not always display visuals/plots, so all plots and images have been added as jpg files and put into the repo.
